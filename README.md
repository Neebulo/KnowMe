## KnowMe

KnowMe is a rapport building app geared towards creating a community audience
such as a team or a group of people. The app is primarily designed for users to
build rapport with one another by revealing a desired personal detail about them
for others to see. Users can comment anonymous or be logged in to reveal their
name. Theoretically, revealing personal details to each other will build a
strong bonding experience. Currently the KnowMe platform is in beta and will
have only its main functional idea.

Users will be able to:
* sign up and Login with name and password

* create POSTS.

* COMMENT on created posts by other Users.

* DELETE their own POST and COMMENT

* Be Anonymous or have a session login associated with the comments they leave.

### Possible Future Developments:

* Group feature - posts will only be accesible by users assigned to certain groups

* Giphy feature - add some giphy to those bad boys.

* Photo feature - add photos functionality.
